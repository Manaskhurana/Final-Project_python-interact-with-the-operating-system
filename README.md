Final-Project of python interact with operating system

The main motive of the project is to make report_check.py to analyse the the system log and make the report in html 

1. regex to split the data witch we need
2. csv_to_html.py helps to convert csv data into html
3. in linux use apach 2 to view the files in localhost
4. user_email.csv and syslog is example data
5. after run the code error_messge.csv file is generated but in my case the data is not show due to peremission denied
6. user_statistics_csv showing in localhost

   keep grinding and never give up
